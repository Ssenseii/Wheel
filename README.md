# THE WHEEL

inspired by a dream... and probably memories of ps2 Naruto games.

The wheel is a selection menu for anything you'd like.

This is a working protoype set within the constraints of desktop webpages only (unresponsive to different viewports).

## Notes for Later Professional Use:

  - Use % and vw / vh for responsivity for widths, heights and most importantly: translations.
  - use buttons instead of divs (set disabled to lock the script until animation is finished)
  - Use variables for translation values.
  - Make it modular.
  - align Y translations with height + margin (use calc())


## later features to be implemented

  - scroll wheel.


# Bugs

  - Hovering glitches the borders (its unnoticeable but still)
  - Clicking repeatedly skips animation and goes straight for value changes
    => make it so that repeated clicking turns off animations completely and goes for free-range mode
