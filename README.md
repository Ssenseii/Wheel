# THE WHEEL

inspired by a dream... and probably memories of ps2 Naruto games.

The wheel is a selection menu for anything you'd like.

This is a working protoype set within the constraints of desktop webpages only (unresponsive to different viewports).

## Notes for Later Professional Use:

  - Use % and vw / vh for responsivity for widths, heights and most importantly: translations.
  - use buttons instead of divs (set disabled to lock the script until animation is finished)
  - Use variables for translation values.
  - Make it modular.
